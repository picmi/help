# Glossary

## Organisation
The business issuing employment agreements. Each organisation manages its own job listings, workflows, and contracts.

## Job
A specific role or position within an organisation that people can apply for. Each job has unique requirements, responsibilities, and conditions.

#### Personal Overrides
Adjustments made to an individual's application to account for unique circumstances. These can include variations in pay rates, job descriptions, and conditions.

## Workflow
The structured series of steps a person follows to complete an application. These steps typically include:
- **Questions**: Collecting personal information, declarations, and confirmations.
- **Information**: Presenting details about the organisation, job, and expectations.
- **Videos**: Providing video content to help applicants understand the role and work environment.

## Contract
A legally binding document presented once all application steps are completed. It details employment terms, including responsibilities, pay, and conditions.

## Contract Template
In PICMI, **contracts** are generated from contract templates, which act as reusable blueprints for employment agreements. These templates contain field substitutions (chips) that dynamically pull in details from the organisation, job, workflow answers, and personal overrides.

## Field Substitutions
A method for personalising contracts by dynamically inserting specific details from the organisation, job, workflow answers, or personal overrides. Field substitutions modify existing content but do not allow sections of the contract to be included or excluded based on conditions.
