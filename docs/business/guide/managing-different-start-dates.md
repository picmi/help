# Managing different start dates in PICMI

## Problem overview
When managing a job with a fixed official start date, you may encounter situations where different people accept at different times and intend to start on different dates. A common challenge is **not knowing exactly when a person will start** before they accept the job offer. This can make it difficult to plan workforce availability and contract details in advance.

## Approach one: Setting a start date in personal conditions

PICMI provides a flexible approach to managing different start dates while ensuring contracts are issued correctly. Here’s how you can handle this situation effectively:

### Step 1: Send a single invite
Each person should receive an invitation to the job. Even if you don’t yet know their exact start date, sending the invite ensures they can review and accept the offer when ready.

### Step 2: Set personal conditions (start date)
Once the person accepts the invite, update their personal conditions to reflect their expected start date. Since PICMI treats the **Start Date** as **“we won’t take you earlier than”**, you can set this date as the earliest possible start date while allowing flexibility for when they actually begin.

## Approach two: Using the summary field for contingencies

If the start date is uncertain, an additional **Summary** field under **Start and End** can help clarify expected start arrangements. This allows you to communicate that the start date is flexible and subject to confirmation.

### Step 1: Navigate to the start and end section
Locate the **Start and End** fields in the job settings.
➡️ [Guide: Updating a job](../article/creating-a-job.md#updating-job-fields)

### Step 2: Add a summary field
Use the **Summary** field to provide details about the start date contingency.

### Step 3: Use clear communication
Here are some example texts to include in the **Summary** field:

- *Your start date reflects the earliest possible day you can begin work. Your actual start may be arranged with your employer after acceptance.*
- *Your official start date may be subject to additional conditions. If different, your employer will confirm the actual start date with you.*
