# Kiwifruit Services Agreement Workflow

PICMI provides a **pre-built workflow template** for creating and managing **Kiwifruit Services Agreements**. This workflow guides both **growers (hosts)** and **contractors (employers)** through all the necessary steps to
prepare, review, and finalise a compliant agreement.

## Overview

The workflow is divided into **9 sections**.

- The **first 3 sections** collect key information **from you (the grower or host)**.
- The **next 5 sections** capture your agreement to detailed information **from the contractor**.
- The **final section** is the **contract itself**, where both parties review and agree to the terms.

Each section builds on the last — by the time you reach the end, all data, certifications, and compliance details needed
for a complete services agreement are in place. You don't have to do them in order and everything is saved. No data is
shared
back to the contractor who is sending the agreement until all sections are complete and the contract is agreed.

**Profile & Services** requires the most work with knowing your orchard profile and service required

## Sections 1–3: Grower Input

These steps collect your information to help define who you are, where your orchards are located, and what work is
required.

:::: explanation

### 1. Contact Information

This section collects the **primary contact details** for your business.  
Provide the information for the **main person we should contact** — typically the orchard manager or the individual
authorised to make agreement decisions.

This includes:

- Name
- Organisation
- Phone number
- Email address

:::prompt
This information is used for all official communication.  
Make sure it belongs to the person who will manage the agreement and answer any queries.
:::

### 2. Profile & Services

This section covers the **layout and key details of your orchard**.  
It helps with accurate planning, service delivery, and matching the right workforce to your needs.

You’ll enter:

- Orchard profiles (names, blocks, KPINs)
- Varieties and maturity
- Sizes and locations
- The specific **services required**, like pruning, thinning, or harvest support

See [here for details on entering orchard profile and services required](./orchard-profile-and-services-required.md)

:::prompt
Make sure your orchard details and services are accurate — they form the foundation of the agreement and may take the
most time to prepare.  
You’ll need to have ready:

- Orchard details (KPIN, size, region, varieties)
- Planned services
  :::

### 3. Worksite

Before workers arrive, we need to understand how things operate on your site.  
This section lets you share documents, manuals, policies, or key instructions we’re expected to follow.

Providing worksite information helps:

- Identify site-specific risks early
- Communicate your expectations clearly
- Support contractor onboarding and training
- Align on safety and compliance from the start

This step helps everyone stay informed and reduces mistakes — but it **does not commit either party to a work schedule**
yet.

You’ll also need to provide a **map of the worksite**.

:::prompt
Include documents like:

- Health and safety policies
- Site induction guides
- Hazard maps or emergency plans

These will be used to train the workforce before they arrive.

## Sections 4–8: Contractor Input

These sections are completed by your **contractor or employer**.  
They provide operational, certification, and compliance information necessary for safety, pay transparency, and legal
requirements.

:::: explanation

### 4. Subcontractors

If a contractor uses subcontractors to deliver services, this section lists **who they are**.  
It ensures you know **exactly who is working on your property** — important for transparency, responsibility, and
compliance.

:::prompt
Hosts (growers) are ultimately responsible for ensuring anyone on their site — including subcontractors — meets safety
and certification standards.
:::

### 5. Certifications

This section contains **key legal and certification records**.  
It covers documents related to:

- Contractor business status
- Insurance coverage
- Health and safety systems
- Compliance certifications (CAV, GAP, SiteWise, GRASP, etc.)

These are important for your own records as well as audit and compliance purposes.

:::prompt
Always check expiry dates and ensure your contractor uploads the latest versions of all certificates.
:::

### 6. Pay Rates

This section outlines how the contractor will pay workers and charge for services.  
Each entry includes:

- The **rate charged** to the orchardist (per hour, hectare, or unit)
- The **rate paid** to employees (hourly or piece rate)
- Notes on invoice and payment timing (further detailed in the contract)

:::prompt
Transparent pay rate details help both parties align expectations and comply with labour laws.
:::

### 7. GRASP

GRASP (**GLOBALG.A.P. Risk Assessment on Social Practice**) practices demonstrate that social and worker welfare
standards are met on your property.  
They show that:

- Workers are treated fairly and safely
- Recordkeeping, training, and daily management meet ethical standards
- The contractor maintains socially responsible practices

This isn’t just about passing an audit — it’s about ensuring a safe, fair working environment that meets market
expectations.

:::prompt
Strong GRASP practices help maintain market access to buyers who value ethical sourcing.
:::

### 8. GLOBALG.A.P.

GLOBALG.A.P. practices confirm your orchard is **growing safely and responsibly** — for workers, the environment, and
the crop.  
They verify:

- Food safety
- Sustainability
- Hygiene and traceability standards

Following GLOBALG.A.P. standards builds trust with markets and retailers and ensures your orchard meets the **baseline
global requirements**.

:::prompt
Transparent, traceable, and well-documented systems are now required by most premium markets — not optional.
:::

## Section 9: Contract Agreement

The final step brings everything together into a **legally binding agreement**.

:::: explanation

1. Review all details gathered in earlier sections.
