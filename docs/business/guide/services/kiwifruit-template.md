# Kiwifruit Services Agreement Workflow

PICMI provides a **pre-built workflow template** for creating and managing **Kiwifruit Services Agreements**.  
This workflow guides both **growers (hosts)** and **contractors (employers)** through all the necessary steps to
prepare, review, and finalise a compliant agreement.

## Overview

The workflow is divided into **9 sections**.

- The **first 3 sections** collect key information **from you (the grower or host)**.
- The **next 5 sections** capture your agreement to detailed information **from the contractor**.
- The **final section** is the **contract itself**, where both parties review and agree to the terms.

Each section builds on the last — by the time you reach the end, all data, certifications, and compliance details needed
for a complete services agreement are in place. You don't have to do them in order and everything is saved. No data is shared 
back to the contractor who is sending the agreement until all sections are complete and the contract is agreed.

## The 9 Sections at a Glance

| Step  | Section                 | Description                                                                                   |
|-------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1** | **Contact Information** | Collects names, phone numbers, and email addresses for both the grower and contractor.        |
| **2** | **Profile & Services**  | Captures orchard information (blocks, varieties, sizes) and the specific services required.   |
| **3** | **Worksite**            | Records worksite addresses and regional details to support compliance and planning.           |
| **4** | **Subcontractors**      | Identifies any subcontractors that will perform work under the agreement.                     |
| **5** | **Certifications**      | Gathers contractor compliance documents such as **CAV**, **GAP**, **SiteWise**, or **GRASP**. |
| **6** | **Pay Rates**           | Defines labour pay structures, rates, and conditions (e.g. hourly vs piece rate).             |
| **7** | **GRASP**               | Adds GRASP (GLOBALG.A.P. Risk Assessment on Social Practice) details where applicable.        |
| **8** | **GLOBALG.A.P.**        | Confirms GLOBALG.A.P. certification coverage, including producer numbers and expiry dates.    |
| **9** | **Contract**            | Final review and signature step — both parties agree to the terms electronically.             |

## Section Breakdown

### Sections 1–3: Grower Input

These steps collect your information to help define who you are, where your orchards are located, and what work is
required.

- **Contact Information** – Basic contact details for your business.
- **Profile & Services** – Orchard profiles, blocks, and service requirements (e.g. pruning, picking). See [here for details on entering orchard profile and service required](./orchard-profile-and-services-required.md)
- **Worksite** – Confirms physical worksite details for compliance and health & safety purposes. **You will need to provide a map of the worksite.**

Once you complete these, your contractor can use them to configure and validate the rest of the agreement.
