# Kiwifruit: Orchard Profile Information and Services Required

This section outlines how to record the layout, key details, and service needs of your orchard. Completing this
information accurately helps ensure **better workforce planning**, **efficient service delivery**, and **compliance
alignment** for both growers and contractors.

Much of this information is already in Canopy and can be copied from the Spray Diary Block Information. Ensure that you
have the latest information before starting.

## Overview

The **Orchard Profile** and **Services Required** sections work together:

- **Orchard Profile** captures information about your orchard — blocks, varieties, size, and maturity.
- **Services Required** links specific orchard blocks (specified in orchard profile) to the **type of work** you need
  performed and the **timeframe** it’s required.

This ensures that the right services, people, and certifications are matched to each site.

## 1. Orchard Profile

### Purpose

The **Orchard Profile** defines the physical and operational characteristics of your orchard. It provides context for
service planning, contract preparation, and regional labour forecasting.

| Field                 | Description                                                         | Example                          |

| **Size (ha)**         | Total orchard area in hectares.                                     | 8.16                             |

## 2. Services Required

### Purpose

The **Services Required** section links your orchard and blocks to specific types of work, required timing, and
compliance conditions. This ensures service providers understand exactly **what**, **where**, and **when** work needs to
be done.

| Field                                 | Description                                                        | Example             |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Orchard Name–Block**                | Links service requests to the orchard and block(s) defined above.  | AB Orchard–1A,2B,3C |
| **Service**                           | The type of work required. Select from the list or enter your own. | Summer Pruning      |
| **Timeframe**                         | When the service should start.                                     | Immediate           |
| **Certification Requirements**        | Certifications required to perform the work.                       | CAV                 |
| **Specific Performance Requirements** | Additional notes on targets, safety, or equipment.                 |                     |

:::prompt
Be as specific as possible in **Service**, **Timeframe**, and **Performance Requirements** — this helps contractors and
teams plan resources accurately.
:::

### How to Add a Service

1. Click **Add** under the *Services Required* section.
2. Complete each field:
    - Choose **Orchard Name–Block** (these come from your Orchard Profile table).
    - Select or type a **Service** (e.g. Summer Pruning, Harvest – Picking).
    - Choose a **Timeframe** (e.g. Immediate, Next Season).
    - Add any required **Certifications** (e.g. CAV, GAP).
    - Optionally, include **Specific Performance Requirements** (e.g. “No rain picking”, “All gold picked hourly”).
3. Click **Done** to save your service entry.

### Example: Completed Services Table

| Orchard Name–Block   | Service           | Timeframe   | Certification Requirements | Specific Performance Requirements |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| AB Orchard–1A,2B,3C  | Summer Pruning    | Immediate   | CAV                        | –                                 |
| AB Orchard–1,2,3,4,5 | Harvest – Picking | Next Season | CAV                        | No rain picking                   |

### Step 3. Validate and Review

Before finalising, double-check:

- Each **Orchard Profile** entry has complete details.
- Each **Service Required** links to an existing Orchard–Block.
- Certification and timing requirements align with the season plan.

If something doesn’t look right:

- Adjust each of fields as needed.
- Click **Done** to save.

## Tips & Best Practices

✅ **Keep your orchard profile current.** Update it before the new season begins.  
✅ **Use consistent naming** for blocks to avoid duplicate records.  
✅ **Check certification requirements** before publishing services.   
✅ **Review before previewing** — check the Edit/Preview toggle to confirm accuracy.

## General troubleshooting

<button @click="toggleExpandAll">{{ expandAll ? 'Collapse All' : 'Expand All' }}</button>

::::faq Why isn’t my orchard showing in the “Services Required” dropdown?
This usually means the **Orchard Profile** hasn’t been saved yet.

To fix:

1. Go to the **Orchard Profile** section.
2. Check that all required fields (like Orchard Name and Region) are complete.
3. Click **Done** to save.

Once saved, your orchard and block combinations will appear in the “Orchard Name–Block” dropdown.
:::prompt
You must have at least one valid Orchard Profile before adding services.
:::
::::

::::faq Why are some orchard blocks missing or not appearing correctly?
This happens when block names are entered with extra spaces or inconsistent formatting.

To fix:

- Enter block names separated by commas **without spaces**.  
  Example:  
  ✅ `1A,2B,3C`  
  ❌ `1A, 2B, 3C`

:::prompt
PICMI treats each block code exactly as entered. Extra spaces or mismatched punctuation can cause blocks not to link
properly.
:::
::::

::::faq Why can’t I save my orchard or service entry?
One or more **required fields** are missing.

To fix:

1. Review all fields in your form.
2. Ensure all *required* fields (marked with asterisks or placeholders) are filled.
3. Click **Done** again.

:::prompt
If the form still doesn’t save, check for validation rules — e.g. the **KPIN** must be numeric and up to 4 digits.
:::
::::

::::faq Why is the timeframe or service schedule wrong?
An incorrect **Timeframe** may have been selected during entry.

To fix:

1. Click **Edit** beside the affected service entry.
2. Select the correct **Timeframe** (e.g. “Immediate”, “Next Season”).
3. Click **Done** to confirm the update.

:::explanation
Timeframes help your contractor plan labour and scheduling. It’s important to keep these accurate for reliable service
delivery.
