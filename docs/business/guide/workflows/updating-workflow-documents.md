# Updating Workflow Documents (files and videos)

As your business evolves, you'll need to update documents and videos within your workflows. This guide walks you through
common updates you'll make to keep your workflows current and compliant.

If you are **UPDATING** a document or video, it is likely that you need ONLY update the **original document with a new
version** as the link will not change.

## Frequently asked questions

:::faq Document uploaded but not showing?

Uploading a document to Google Drive doesn't automatically add it to your workflow. You must explicitly add the link or
embed it in the workflow editor.
:::

:::faq Link not working for applicants?

Check your document's sharing permissions. Set links to "Anyone with the link can view" if you want all applicants to
access them.
