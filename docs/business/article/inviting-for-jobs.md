# Inviting for jobs

Once you've [created a job](creating-a-job.md) (ideally [duplicated](duplicate-a-job.md)), it should be straight forward to invite people to apply for a job. 

<prompt>

Before you send out an invitation ensure that the job and application workflow is all correct and that there are enough [vacancies](../about-picmi/applications.md#restrictions-on-actions)

</prompt>

<explanation>

## General process

* use the <span class="mdi mdi-help-circle-outline">Help Tour Guide</span> to learn about the major functions
* know the people you want to receive an invite to a job
* only people **with an email** can receive an invite digitally (ie by email)
* can search for existing people who have been previously invited on other jobs 
* add a personal message to the email (include reusing existing messages from other people)
* only after an invite has been generated (or provisional user created), can [personal overrides](creating-individual-employment-conditions) be added to the application for individual employment conditions
* the outgoing email can be previewed
* you can send more than one email at a time
* you can import multiple email records through the clipboard (as well as download templates for each) from
  * Email application contacts list 
  * Google Sheets
  * CSV
  * Numbers
  * Excel 
* PICMI provides downloadable templates to be used in the spreadsheet applications

<prompt>

People **without** an email can be added as a [provisional user](provisional-user.md)—they are then invited or contacted by other means
