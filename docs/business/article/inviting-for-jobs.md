# Inviting for jobs

Once you've [created a job](creating-a-job.md) (ideally [duplicated](duplicate-a-job.md)), it should be straight forward to invite people to apply for a job. 

<prompt>

Before you send out an invitation ensure that the job and application workflow is all correct and that there are enough [vacancies](../about-picmi/applications.md#restrictions-on-actions)

## General process

* select the people you want to have an invite to a job
* only people **with an email** can receive an invite digitally (ie by email)
* add a personal message to the email (include reusing existing ones)
* only after an invite has been generated (or provisional user created), can [personal overrides](creating-individual-employment-conditions) be added to the application for individual employment conditions
* you can send more than one email at a time
* the outgoing email can be previewed
* search for people who already exist
* import multiple email records through the clipboard (as well as download templates for each) from
  * Email application contacts list 
  * Google Sheets
  * CSV
  * Numbers
  * Excel 

<prompt>

People **without** an email can be added as a [provisional user](provisional-user.md)—they are then invited or contacted by other means

## Send invites

This is the simplest way to send a single email.

1. Go to **Jobs**
2. Locate the job row <span class="mdi mdi-checkbox-marked-outline"></span>
3. Click <span class="mdi mdi-dots-vertical"/> (vertical dots) to open menu
4. Select **Send Invites**
5. Click **Invite**
6. Add Email address 
7. Optionally more can be added
   * Name
   * Personal Message
8. When you are ready, click **Send**

Back in the list you can watch the process of the email being sent

<prompt>

Avoid typing an email address by using import or copy-and-paste to ensure that you don't introduce unnecessary errors—bounced email addresses will be notified and the application should be cancelled
