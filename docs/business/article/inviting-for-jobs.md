# Inviting for jobs

Once you've created a job, it should be straight forward to invite jobseekers to a job. 

Before you send out an invitation to a job:

* ensure that the job and application workflow is all correct

To send out invites:

* select the people you want to email
* select any specifics you want for the jobseeker (like pay rate, see [listing complex situations](creating-a-listing#complex-situations))
