# Creating individual employment conditions

For any application, the business can provide specific terms for a person. They are called **personal overrides** to
provide individual employment conditions. Personal overrides are added over the top of any **base** field values that
are
provided.

<prompt>

Changes can be made applications right up until the person agrees—after that changes cannot be made.

</prompt>

## Where are the personal overrides reflected?

For both the person and the business, everywhere in the context of an application these override values will be used
instead of the base values. This includes:

* job details view
* contracts (inside the substitution fields)

## Fields that can be overridden

| **Field**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Remuneration**                | The pay rate itself (and not the currency eg NZ, or frequency eg hourly—these remain the same as the job itself)                                                                       |

| **Date summary**                | A description of the dates or supplementary information. Examples are general start or end date conditions (such as weather or fruit conditions), or job-specific notification periods |
| **Valid through**               | Allow the application to close before the job starts                                                                                                                                   |
| **Location**                    | The street address of the position                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Location additional details** | Supplementary information about the location                                                                                                                                           |
| **Job description**             | Change this to rewrite the primary description—overwriting this should probably include details from the original description                                                          |
| **Organisation name**           | Sometimes the contracting organisation may change                                                                                                                                      |
