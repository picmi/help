# Creating individual employment conditions

For any jobseeker application (aka a job), the business can "override" a number of "base" values to ensure that there are individual employment conditions. All these changes should be able to be made by the business right up until the jobseeker agrees.

## Fields that can be overridden

1. **Remuneration**: the pay rate itself (and not the currency eg NZ, or frequency eg hourly—these remain the same as the job itself)
2. **Start**: date the job is expected to begin
3. **End**: date the job is expected to finish
4. **Date summary**: a description of the dates or supplementary information
5. **Valid through**: allow the application to close before the job starts
6. **Location**: the street address of the position
7. **Location additional details**: supplementary information about the location
8. **Job description**: change this to rewrite the primary description—overwriting this should probably include details from the original description
9. **Organisation name**: sometimes the contracting organisation may change

## Where are the changes reflected?

For both the jobseeker and the business, everywhere in the context of a job application these override values will be used instead of the base values. This includes:

* listing details view
* contracts (inside the substitution chips)

## Change field override

1. Go to the **People page**
2. Select the jobseeker application
3. Click **Edit application overrides**
4. Enter a new __field__ value (based on above)
5. Click **Save**
