# Creating individual employment conditions

For any application, the business can provide specific terms for a person. They are called **personal overrides** to
provide individual employment conditions. Personal overrides are added over the top of any **base** field values that are
provided.

**Note:** changes can be made applications right up until the person agrees—after that changes cannot be made.

## Where are the personal overrides reflected?

For both the person and the business, everywhere in the context of an application these override values will be used
instead of the base values. This includes:

* job details view
* contracts (inside the substitution fields)

## Fields that can be overridden
