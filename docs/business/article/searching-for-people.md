# Searching for people and their application

PICMI allows you to find and track all applications and their [status](../about-picmi/applications.md#application-status). Finding an application requires using the search fields correctly. Here are the [general search filter instructions](search.md).

<explanation>

### Search fields

* **Email address or name**: an empty field picks any name or email address
* **Application status**: a status must be selected for any applications to be returned
* **Dates**: dates that the application was last updated
* **Jobs**: an empty job picks any job (these are from your list of jobs)

If you can't find your person then it is likely your Status filter does not match their application status
