# Preparing a job ready to publish

All jobs must be valid for a person to receive an offer on their application. Above completing the fields with the correct information which can be checked when [previewing a listing](previewing-a-job), a valid job must:

* have all job fields that are going to be substituted in a contract completed (eg pay rate)
* have an application workflow (which includes the employment agreement)

<instructions>

## Check that the job is valid

1. Go to **Jobs**
2. Locate the **job** row <span class="mdi mdi-checkbox-marked-outline"></span>
3. Click &vellip; (vertical dots) to open the menu
4. Select **Check Configuration** 
5. Confirm the **Validate** status
   * <span class="mdi mdi-check primary"></span> for success 
   * <span class="mdi mdi-exclamation"></span> for errors&mdash;ensure they are fixed before sending invites
   
</instructions>

**Note:** the listing will also be validated an [inviting a person](inviting-for-jobs), [duplicating a job](duplicate-a-job) and when a person agrees.
