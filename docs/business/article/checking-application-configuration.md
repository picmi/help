# Checking an application configuration

There is checking around an application to ensure that contracts can be issued and that data can be sent to any required integrations. The goal is that when the application is complete, there is no extra work to remedy errors by anyone.

All application configurations must be valid for a person to receive an offer on their application. Above completing the
fields with the correct information which can be checked when [previewing a listing](previewing-a-job).

A valid application configuration must have all **fields completed** that are going to be substituted in 
* a contract
* all integrations configured on the job

Integration validations can be turned off to get around this (not recommended)
