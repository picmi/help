# Creating and adding business users

In PICMI, adding or removing business users is simple and helps manage who has access to your account.

- **Adding a user:** When you want someone in your organisation to use PICMI, you can invite them by entering their email address. They’ll receive an email to set up their account and get access to your PICMI workspace.

- **Removing a user:** If someone no longer needs access, you can remove them from your account. This ensures they won’t be able to log in or see any of your business data.

These steps are quick and help keep your team organised while maintaining security.
