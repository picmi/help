# Job application controls

By default, a job can accept an unlimited number of applications. However, there are times when the number of
individuals applying or specific types of people need to be limited.

Without restrictions, anyone with a link to the job can **apply**. To limit applications to invited individuals only,
use the **Invites only** setting. You can also set a limit on the number of applications.

| **Setting**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Invites only | Only people with an existing application (in invited) can **apply** for the job. This setting restricts applications to individuals who receive a specific invitation.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Vacancies    | Sets a maximum number of people who can have an **accepted** application for the job. When this limit is reached, no further applications will be **offered**. The total count includes people who have been offered, accepted, or completed the job. Applicants with cancelled or terminated applications are not counted towards this limit.
