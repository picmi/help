# Group hiring onsite

When hiring a group of workers onsite, it's important to create a smooth and efficient hiring process. This guide covers
**setting up provisional users, preparing the environment, and working through contracts and templates**, with special
considerations for second-language speakers.

## Setting up provisional users

1. **Ensure active access for all workers**
    - Every worker must have an **Access Key** with **active access** before starting.
    - Make sure all Access Keys are set up correctly. If there are issues, check the invite status to ensure access has
      been updated.

2. **Filtering for provisional users**
    - Limit your search to **Invited** users to focus on those who need to complete their setup.
    - Customise the columns to show only **Provisional User** details for clarity.

## Preparing the environment

- **Find a room that is the right size** for the group—too big can be distracting, too small can be uncomfortable.
- **Choose a well-lit, well-ventilated space** if possible, to keep workers comfortable.
- **Limit groups to 15 or fewer** to encourage individual engagement and avoid overwhelming participants.
- **Stagger sessions** so that workers don’t have to wait too long—smaller groups finishing at different times reduces
  frustration.
- **Pair up workers with devices**—match those who have devices with those who don’t.
- **Identify experienced workers who can help explain**, including providing translation if needed.

## Working through contracts and templates

### Step one: new workers

- **Use a projector** to go through the process as a group.
- **Walk through the workflow together**, explaining each section clearly.
- **Encourage questions** and take time to explain everything thoroughly.
- **Spend extra time on induction, health and safety, and contract sections**, ensuring everyone understands their
  responsibilities.
- **Complete the process in one go**, ensuring every worker finishes their setup.

### Step two: returning workers

- **Use a projector** keep going through the process as a group.
- **Do a quicker walkthrough**, showing that the process is faster for them.

### Step three:  returning workers

- **Then let them complete it independently**—either alone, in pairs, or in small groups.
- **Float around to assist** where needed, helping workers complete the process efficiently.

**Expected timeframes**

- **Step one & two**: expect an hour or two per group depending on skills and experience
- **Returning workers individual completion**: 2–5 minutes (only need to update new details)
- **New workers individual completion**: Around 30 minutes (full setup required)

### Special considerations for second-language speakers

- **Speak slowly and clearly**, using simple language and avoiding jargon.
- **Use visual aids or demonstrations** to reinforce key points.
- **Encourage workers to ask questions**—some may hesitate, so check in with individuals.
- **Provide translations or interpreters** where possible, or identify bilingual workers who can assist.

### Take breaks

- **Plan short breaks** to keep workers engaged and prevent fatigue.
- **Offer water and a chance to stretch**—this helps maintain focus, especially for new workers who need more time.
