# Using Provisional Users with a shared email address

Provisional Users in PICMI provide a streamlined way for individuals to apply for jobs without needing a personal email address or account. This is particularly useful in environments where a **shared email address** is REQUIRED — for example, by staff assisting applicants at correctional facilities or employment hubs.

Provisional users with a shared email requires all the people completing the application to enter the shared email. All email notifications will be sent to this email inbox.

Using this approach requires the business to [send instructions](#reference-instructions-to-third-patry) to the third-party institution with access code and access keys and for the person to enter the email address into their application.

## What is a Provisional User?

A **Provisional User** is someone who accesses a PICMI job application using an **access code** and their **name**, rather than a full account.

This setup is ideal when:

- Applicants do not have or cannot use personal email addresses.
- A facilitator is guiding many individuals through applications.
- Devices such as shared tablets or kiosks are used to access applications.


## Shared email context

In organizations like the correctional facilities, applicants use a **shared email** address that is not in their control and is monitored by the institution for all communication.

PICMI supports this by:

- Routing all contracts and correspondence to that email.
- Tracking each individual’s session through unique **access codes**.
- Allowing the admin interface to show per-user details such as 
  - `Access Code`
  - `Access Key` 
  - `Email`
