# Adding provisional users

Once you've [created a job](creating-a-job.md) (ideally [duplicated](duplicate-a-job.md)), it should be straight forward to add a person who does not have an email for a job. 

<prompt>

Only create provisional users when a person has no email address currently available. As a business you should help people setup an email account as quickly as possible. Provisional users are created ready to apply for a specific job. A single provisional user cannot have multiple jobs.

</prompt>

## Type of access
Provisional users have specific access details to log into PICMI and don't use a username and password. There are three ways to [provide access details](#provide-details-to-a-person) and all options are available to be used at any time.

* **Direct link** is active for 30 days from generation, containing a unique code. Links are regenerated on each page load and are suitable for sending via messages. They should not be saved for later use.
* **QR code** is active for 30 days from generation, which can be scanned or downloaded and printed for later use. QR codes are regenerated on each page load.
* **Access key/code/expiry** is active for a specified number of days. These are entered separately (via a link) and can be added or changed at any time. The system generates these codes automatically, and the same key can be used for different provisional users. It is recommended to use an easy-to-type and personally-identifiable key, such as a name.
