# Adding provisional users

Create provisional users when a person has **no email address currently available**. Provisional users are created with an application ready to apply for a specific job.  

Once you've [created a job](creating-a-job.md) (ideally [duplicated](duplicate-a-job.md)), it should be straight forward to add a person who does not have an email for a job. 

::: prompt
As a business you should help people set up an email account as quickly as possible.

:::: explanation
## Type of access
Provisional users have specific access details to log into PICMI and don't use a username and password. There are three ways to [provide access details](#provide-details-to-a-person) and all options are available to be used at any time.

* **Direct link** is active for 30 days from generation, containing a unique code. Links are regenerated on each page load and are suitable for sending via messages. They should not be saved for later use.
* **QR code** is active for 30 days from generation, which can be scanned or downloaded and printed for later use. QR codes are regenerated on each page load.
* **Access key/code/expiry** is active for a specified number of days—and can be stopped/revoked at any time. Access is via a **key** and a **code**. The key is provided by the business to identify a person. It is recommended to use an easy-to-type and personally-identifiable key, such as, a name. The code is generated by the system and can be regenerated at any time. The key can be repeated across different people because it is matched with a code. Duplicate keys are not recommended because it can make identifying users against people harder.
