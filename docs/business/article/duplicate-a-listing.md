# Duplicate a listing

An existing listing can be duplicated to make a copy. It will contain all the details of the previous job. The default change is to change the name of the job. The application workflow remains the same. All fields that can be changed specific to the new job.

Note: **vacancy** numbers are not copied and must be set individually.

## To create a duplicate

1. Go to **Jobs** page
2. Locate the row <span class="mdi mdi-checkbox-marked-outline"></span> with the listing/job to duplicate
2. Click <span class="mdi mdi-dots-horizontal"/> (horizontal dots) to open menu
3. Select **Duplicate Job**
3. Click **Duplicate**

The new job should be in the list (default "_Copy of ..._"), if you can't see it click **Refresh**

## Making final changes

1. Go to **Jobs** page
2. On the newly duplicated job, click on the **Listing** title to start editing
3. Move through the fields as you would normally and update values and **Save** as needed
