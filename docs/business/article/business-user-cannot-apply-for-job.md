# Access job applications from business user

## Error Message
**Business user cannot apply for a job**

## Why this happened
- The person has a *business account* instead of a jobseeker account
  - this could be a business user who wants to try and apply and they should use a provisional user instead; or
  - it is a jobseeker who has created a business

<prompt>

Business accounts are only for companies managing their hiring, not for job applications and to apply for a job, you need to use a *jobseeker account*

</prompt>

<explanation>

## How to fix it
1. **Jobseeker**
    - The jobseeker can fix it themselves
    - [This link](../../jobseeker/article/business-user-cannot-apply-for-job) provides the instructions

<prompt>

Do not **cancel** the application and invite againâ€”that can make it harder for jobseekers because they now have two invites and the first one will no longer work

</prompt>

2. **Business**
    - [Cancel](changing-application-status.md) the application with a [status message](status-message)
    - Invite by [adding a provisional user](provisional-user.md#add-a-provisional-user)
