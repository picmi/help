# Duplicate a Contract Template

An existing contract template can be duplicated to make a copy. It will contain all the details of the previous contract template. The default change is to change the name of the contract template.

::: prompt
The issue is that when you copy and paste from an existing contract, the chips (field placeholders) visually look the same, but they’re still linked to the old contract details. This is why they don’t match properly in the new contract.

### To fix the validations

Update Each Field (Chip):

1. Click to the right of each chip.
2. Delete it using your keyboard.
3. Find the correct chip in the right-hand panel and reinsert it.
4. Once all the chips are re-added, the validate/save function will work correctly.
