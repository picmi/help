# Status message

A status message is a way to provide **extra information about an application** at each stage of the process. These
messages help both the business and the person applying to understand what's happening with the application.

## Visibility

Status messages have two levels of visibility:

* **Shared** Visible to jobseeker and triggers
  notification ([preview available](#preview-an-email-template) <span class="mdi mdi-account-eye-outline"></span>)
* **Internal**: Business-only, not visible to jobseeker

<prompt>

Notifications go to jobseekers via in-app messages and emailsâ€”the email can be previewed

</prompt>

<explanation>

## For the business

* **Extra Details:** A status message can be used to give the business more details about the current state of an
  application. For example, if an application has been reissued so that information can be changed, the status message
  might explain that the person needs to update. PICMI recommends this information has [shared visibility](#visibility)
* **Tracking Progress:** It helps the business track each step more clearly, so they know why an application is in a
  particular stage, such as, if a contract was terminated a reason could be added. PICMI recommends this information
  has [internal visibility](#visibility)

## For the person applying

* **Clear Communication:** When notifications are sent to individuals about their application, the status message is
  included. This gives the person clear and relevant information about where they stand in the process.

## Examples of status messages

Status messages ensure that everyone involved is kept informed, making the process smoother and more transparent.

### Extra Details (shared)

These examples have a focus on communicating with the person applying and getting them to act

```
You are no longer required
No longer required (not available for the required work as stated in their contract)
Application has been reissed, please change your tax code and and accept
Please read the updated contract and accept too sign the contract
```

### Tracking progress (internal)

These examples have a focus on communicating with others in the business now and in the future to know about what
was done/decided or what needs to be done.

```
No response via phone and txt
Followed up with 2x emails, 1x text. No response.
Did not turn up to work
No longer available
```

<prompt>

A status message can be added to each application's status to provide more details. The most recent status message is
displayed on the People view, and shared status messages are included in **notifications** to keep everyone informed.

You can view the history of status messages from previous statuses, and previous status messages can also be reused by
copying them into a new status. Additionally, you can search for status messages across different people.

## Reuse existing and previous messages

PICMI recommends that you try to save time and have consistency by reusing messages. Previous messages can be found in
two ways:

* **[Existing messages](#add-existing-message) across all applications**: scan for messages that have been used in the
  same application status so that the experience is similar across people applying
* **[Previous versions of messages](#add-previous-message) in the current application**: check that your messaging is consistent with what the
  person might be expecting based on previous communication
