# Status Messages

A status message gives helpful context about where an application is in the hiring process. Think of it as a note attached to the application at a particular stage—used to update both the business and the applicant on what’s happening, what’s needed, or what’s coming next.

These messages can explain:
- Why something changed
- What action is required
- What to expect next

When the application status changes, the attached status message is no longer active unless a new one is added. This means it might look like the message has been cleared, but it's still part of the history. The most recent message won’t necessarily be the one that’s currently active.

To get the full picture, always check the message history on **this application only** to see what was shared at each step of the process. When adding a message try and reuse messages as much as possible from **all applications**.

::: prompt
The **active** status message is visible in the People view as a custom column for each application, and it's also clearly labelled in the status message history list.
:::

## Visibility

Status messages have two levels of visibility:

* **Shared** Visible to jobseeker and triggers
  notification ([preview available](#preview-an-email-template) :::icon account-eye-outline:::)
* **Internal**: Business-only, not visible to jobseeker

::: prompt
Notifications go to jobseekers via in-app messages and emails—the email can be previewed
:::

<explanation>

## For the business

* **Extra Details:** A status message can be used to give the business more details about the current state of an
  application. For example, if an application has been reissued so that information can be changed, the status message
  might explain that the person needs to update. PICMI recommends this information has [shared visibility](#visibility)
* **Tracking Progress:** It helps the business track each step more clearly, so they know why an application is in a
  particular stage, such as, if a contract was terminated a reason could be added. PICMI recommends this information
  has [internal visibility](#visibility)

## For the person applying

* **Clear Communication:** When notifications are sent to individuals about their application, the status message is
  included. This gives the person clear and relevant information about where they stand in the process.

## Examples of status messages

Status messages ensure that everyone involved is kept informed, making the process smoother and more transparent. 

::: prompt
Messages can be multi-line and formatted (eg bold, bullet points).
:::

### Extra Details (shared)

These examples have a focus on communicating with the person applying and getting them to act

```
You are no longer required
No longer required (not available for the required work as stated in their contract)
Application has been reissed, please change your tax code and and accept
Please read the updated contract and accept too sign the contract
```

### Tracking progress (internal)

These examples have a focus on communicating with others in the business now and in the future to know about what
was done/decided or what needs to be done.

```
No response via phone and txt
Followed up with 2x emails, 1x text. No response.
Did not turn up to work
No longer available
```

::: prompt
A status message can be added to each person's application status to provide more details. The active status message is
displayed on the People view, and shared status messages are included in **notifications** to keep everyone informed.

You can view the history of status messages from previous statuses, and previous status messages can also be reused by
copying them into a new status. Additionally, you can search for status messages across different people's applications.

## Reuse existing and previous messages

PICMI recommends that you try to save time and have consistency by reusing messages. Previous messages can be found in
two ways:

* **[Existing messages](#copy-from-all-applications) across all applications**: scan for messages that have been used in the
  same application status so that the experience is similar across people applying
* **[Previous versions of messages](#copy-from-this-application-only) in the current application**: check that your messaging is
  consistent with what the
  person might be expecting based on previous communication

## Understanding Previous Status Messages

PICMI allows you to reuse messages that have been sent previously, which can save time and help maintain consistency.

There are two types of previous messages you can reuse:

- [**All Applications**](#copy-from-all-applications):  
  Messages sent across all applications. This is the most commonly used option, especially when sending the same type of message to different people.
- [**This Application Only**](#copy-from-this-application-only):  
  Messages that were sent specifically for the current application. These are typically used when you want to resend a message to the same person.

To help you find the right message to reuse, the system displays a shorter, unformatted version of each message. You can expand these to view the full text with formatting.

Each message also shows:
- The status it was originally added on
- Whether it is internal or shared
- The date it was sent

By considering both where the message came from and what you want to achieve—whether it’s prompting action, offering a gentle reminder, or simply sharing information—you can confidently choose the most effective message to reuse.
