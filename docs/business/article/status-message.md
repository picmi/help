# Status message

A status message is a way to provide **extra information about an application** at each stage of the process. These
messages
help both the business and the person applying to understand what's happening with the application.

<explanation>

### For the business

* **Extra Details:** A status message can be used to give the business more details about the current state of an
  application. For example, if an application has been reissued so that information can be changed, the status message
  might explain
  that the person needs to update.
* **Tracking Progress:** It helps the business track each step more clearly, so they know why an application is in a
  particular stage, such as, if a contract was terminated a reason could be added.

### For the person applying

* **Clear Communication:** When notifications are sent to individuals about their application, the status message can be
  included. This gives the person clear and relevant information about where they stand in the process.

### Examples of status messages

```

No longer required (not available for the required work as stated in their contract
No response via phone and txt
Followed up with 2x emails, 1x text. No response.

Status messages ensure that everyone involved is kept informed, making the process smoother and more transparent.

A status message can be added to each application's status to provide more details. The most recent status message is
displayed on the People view, and some status messages are included in **notifications** to keep everyone informed.

You can view the history of status messages from previous statuses, and previous status messages can also be reused by
copying them into a new status. Additionally, you can search for status messages across different people.
