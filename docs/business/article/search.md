# Searching

In PICMI, tables or lists of data can be filtered based on specific criteria, known as *search filters*. Familiarising yourself with search functions helps locate information quickly, though each area may offer different filter options.

## A search interaction

Searching has three different types of selection: _text, date and select_

### Text search 

Text search is dependent on the table  but is usually the primary category of the table eg, name or email

<instructions>

## Search for value

1. Click in the search field.
2. Type values to filter results automatically.
3. Use the "X" on the right to clear the text.

</instructions>

### Date selection
  * Choose a single date.
  * Select a date range.
  * Filter up to a date or after a date.
  * Change the boundary from day to month.
  * Choose relative dates, such as:
      * Last week
      * Last fortnight
      * Last month

<instructions>

## Select a date

1. Choose one of the options above.
2. Click Apply to refresh search results.

</instructions>

### Drop-down selection (indicated by a chevron down)

* If empty, shows the name of the area.
* When one item is selected, displays the value in bold.
* When multiple items are selected, displays the area name with a count in bold.

<instructions>

## Select from drop-down

1. Click the button.
2. Choose items individually; or
3. Click Clear to remove selections.
4. Click All to select all items.
5. Click Apply to update results.

</instructions>

Remember to click Apply to refresh results, as selections don’t update automatically to allow multiple choices at once.

## Search results

Results appear in either a table or a list.

* **Table**: Displays results in columns, some of which may be sortable, with a “paging” mechanism to limit the viewable results.
* **List**: Shows all results at once.

### Sorting instructions

Sorting in PICMI tables involves two main mechanisms:

#### 1. Direction

Each column with sorting enabled has two possible directions:
- **Ascending**: Items are sorted from lowest to highest, such as A–Z or 1–9.
- **Descending**: Items are sorted from highest to lowest, like Z–A or 9–1.
- **To change direction**: Click on the column header once to activate sorting in ascending order, and click again to switch to descending. A third click removes the sort.

#### 2. Order of Combined Sorting

When sorting multiple columns at once, PICMI follows a **combined sort order**:
- **Primary Sort**: The first column you click becomes the primary sort, meaning it determines the main ordering.
- **Secondary and Additional Sorts**: Additional columns add layers of sorting. For example, if you first sort by “Date” and then by “Name,” PICMI will first sort by date and then, within each date, by name.
- **Changing Order**: To change the order of combined sorts, click columns in the desired sequence. The numbers shown on each column header indicate the order of combined sorting.

If the order is not what you expected, remove all sorts by clicking twice on each sorted column, then start again.

#### Single sort on columns

1. Hover over table columns and check if there’s an arrow icon.
    * Up arrow: sorts in ascending order.
    * Down arrow: sorts in descending order.
2. Click the column heading to activate sorting.
3. Click again to change the direction.

#### Multiple sort on columns

* Multiple sorting can be applied to columns.
* Look at the numbered order on columns.
* To remove a sort, click the column heading twice.

If sorting isn’t working, try removing all sorts and restarting.

## Remembering searches

PICMI remembers your last search criteria and applies it automatically when you return.

::: prompt
If results seem unexpected, double-check your search filters to adjust them as needed.
