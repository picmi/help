# Job status

A job can have three different statuses—_open, closed, or started_—based on the job's **start** and **end dates**. 

<prompt>

Both start and end dates are optional

</prompt>

<explanation>

## Open
- The job is **open** when it is available for applications and has not yet started or ended.
- **Example**: The start date is in the future or not set, and the end date has not passed (or is not set).

## Started
- The job is considered **started** when the job’s start date has arrived or passed, but the end date has not yet been reached.
- **Example**: The start date is in the past or today, and the end date is either in the future or not set.

## Closed
- The job is **closed** when it is no longer active. This usually means the end date has passed, regardless of whether a start date was set.
- **Example**: The end date has passed, or the job has been manually closed, even if there was no start date.
