# Searching for jobs or proposals

PICMI allows you to find and track all opportunities (employment jobs or service proposals) and by [status](../article/job-status). Finding a either requires using the search filter fields correctly. Here are the [general search filter instructions](search.md).

:::: explanation
### Search fields

* **Free text**: matches against title of the opportunity
* **Status**: a status ([not start, open or closed](job-status.md)) must be selected for any applications to be returned
* **Dates**: dates that the opportunity was last updated

::: prompt
Keep this view clean by ensuring opportunities are **closed**. Do this by keeping the [end date updated](job-status.md#update-job-dates) on the opportunity.
