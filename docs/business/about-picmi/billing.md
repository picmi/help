# Billing guide for PICMI

This page provides an overview of billing in PICMI, including details on our pay-as-you-go model, fees per contract, billing frequency, how to view and manage your invoices, and where to find support.

Thank you for using PICMI. We’re committed to providing transparent, flexible billing so you can focus on building your team.

## Billing model

PICMI operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning you only **pay for what you use**. Each contract signed in PICMI incurs a billing event, making this model flexible and cost-effective for businesses of all sizes.

### Per contract fee

For each legally binding contract signed in PICMI, a fee of **$19** in New Zealand dollars (NZD) plus any taxes is charged. This cost applies to each contract, ensuring businesses pay only for their hires through an accepted application. It is also includes the cost of storage of the data.

A "signed contract" is defined as follows

- **Single employment agreement per job**: A signed contract is when a person agrees to the employment agreement as part of the application process for one job only.
- **Single fee per agreed application**: You are billed only once per application when a person agrees to the employment terms for a specific job. Each application represents one person.
- **Termination and completion**: Terminated and completed contracts always incur a fee because they have been agreed upon, regardless of the outcome of the employment.
- **No additional charges for reissued contracts**: Reissued contracts do not incur an extra fee if they are agreed upon again, ensuring no duplicate billing for revisions.
- **Charges for reused applications**: If an application is reused for another job, it will incur a separate charge, as each application is job-specific.

PICMI maintains a straightforward model of charging to keep costs low for all users. We encourage our customers to recognise that disputing these costs can lead to higher costs for everyone, and we hope you’ll join us in supporting this transparent approach.

### No activity, no charges

If you have **no accepted applications in a month**, there will be **no charge** for that period. You will not receive an invoice in months with no charges, simplifying your accounting.

## Billing frequency

PICMI issues invoices based on usage

* **Monthly invoicing**: Invoices are sent to a nominated business email account sometime between the 1st and the 10th of each month. Payment is due on the 20th of the month.

* **Itemised transactions**: Each invoice details the number of contracts signed and the corresponding charges. Invoices are issued via Xero and include PDF attachments.

Adding the right particulars to bank transfers is essential for ensuring that payments are correctly attributed to your PICMI account. Here’s the recommended approach for both domestic and international transfers.

<explanation>

### Domestic Bank Transfers (New Zealand)

1. **Bank Reference Field**: When initiating a bank transfer within New Zealand, use the bank’s **reference** or **particulars** field to add the following
    - **Your Business Name**: Ensure that the name matches the business name registered with PICMI.
    - **Invoice Number**: Adding the invoice number in this field helps PICMI quickly match the payment to the correct billing period.

2. **Tips for Accuracy**
    - Double-check that all details match those on your invoice.
    - Contact your bank if you are unsure how to add details in the reference field.

### International Bank Transfers

1. **Using the Reference Field for International Payments**
    - For international transfers, you may have a **message to recipient** or **reference** field. Use this field to provide:
        - **Your Business Name**: As registered with PICMI.
        - **Invoice Number**: Including this helps PICMI identify the payment.

2. **Additional Fields in International Transfers**
    - Depending on your bank, you may also have fields like **reason for payment**. If so, add “PICMI Invoice” or “Service Payment” along with the invoice number.
    - Ensure the payment is in New Zealand Dollars (NZD) to avoid delays or conversion issues.

3. **Bank Transfer Details**
    - Verify PICMI’s bank details on your invoice to ensure accurate entry.
    - Consider adding any **SWIFT/BIC codes** if required for the transfer.

::: prompt
For both domestic and international payments, allow time for the payment to process and confirm with PICMI if the payment does not reflect on your account after the standard processing time (typically 1-5 business days for international payments).

## Viewing and managing invoices

- **PICMI sends you invoices by email**: Invoices are emailed monthly and include a PDF attachment for easy record-keeping.
- **Maintain your own copies**: PICMI does not retain previous invoices directly in the PICMI app, so it is your responsibility to save copies for your records.
- **Requesting historical records**: If you need past invoices, please contact the PICMI team for assistance.

## Handling mistaken application invitations

If you’ve sent an application to the wrong person, don’t worry—mistakes happen, especially when managing multiple hires or working under pressure. Here’s how to resolve it

<explanation>

### Resolving mistaken applications
1. **Identify the mistake** and cancel the incorrect application in PICMI and add a status message.
2. **Send a new invite** to the correct person or correct invite to the person.
3. **Notify PICMI** at **billing@picmi.io** with the details of the mistake.

</explanation>

We won’t charge you for the incorrectly issued contract, and this adjustment will be noted on your monthly invoice. Be sure to review your invoice at the end of the month to confirm the correction has been applied.
