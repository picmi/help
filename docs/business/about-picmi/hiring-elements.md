## Organisation
This is the business that is issuing employment agreements. 

## Job
Within each organisation, there are specific roles or positions available. Each job has its own set of requirements, responsibilities, and details that a person needs to consider when applying.

## Workflow
he workflow consists of various steps that the person goes through to apply for the job. This typically includes:

- **Questions**: The person may need to answer questions to provide personal information, make declarations and confirm their understanding
- **Information**: The person may be presented with details about the organisation, the job, and what is expected.
- **Videos**: There may be video content to help the person understand the role and environment better.

## Contract
Once the person has successfully navigated through the workflow and met all the requirements, they will be presented with a contract. This document outlines the terms of employment, including responsibilities, salary, and other important details. The contract also allows for **dynamically added details** from the organisation, job, workflow answers as well as personal overrides.
