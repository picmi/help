# Check integration status of person record

When data is shared with other systems, this is generally called an "integration". Each integration has an "integration
provider"â€”these are the payroll, HRIS and on-site systems. Each time data is shared this is called an "integration
event". Inside each event are data is "record" made up of "fields" which are the values that are shared. Each field will
have different data and there are rules around that data that may mean it succeeds or fails.

### General integration rules

* only accepted applications can be integrated
* only send data (which means make a new record) in the integration if no record exists
* do not update existing records
