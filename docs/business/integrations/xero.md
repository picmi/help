## Authorisation

* [OAuth](integrations.md#different-ways-to-authorise-picmi-to-transfer-data)

## Troubleshooting

If you notice any discrepancies between PICMI and Xero:

- **Re-authorisation**: If needed, re-authorise the integration by reconnecting your Xero account.
- **Email field with sub-alias**: If an employee's job has ended and some time has passed, you can’t create a new user
  with the same email
  address. To handle this, PICMI will automatically create the user using a [sub-alias email](../faqs#emails) of the
  original email **adding the month and year** (eg `hone.smith+08-2024@example.com`)

<prompt>

PICMI will automatically keep your token up to date by refreshing it before it expires (at about the half-way point)
