## Authorisation

To connect PICMI with EmploymentHero, we can either use **OAuth** (a simple one-click authorisation) or an **API key**.
Just make sure you sign in to both EmploymentH

<explanation>

### OAuth

For OAuth ensure that are already signed in to both systems in your browser to link the two systems.

[Read more about OAuth in our integrations guide](integrations.md#different-ways-to-authorise-picmi-to-transfer-data)

### Key things to know about EmploymentHero's authorisation rules:

- When you first connect PICMI to EmploymentHero, EmploymentHero gives us a **one-time code**. This code **expires after
  5 minutes**, so it
  must be used quickly.
- That one-time code lets PICMI securely request:
    - An **access token** – this allows us to talk to EmploymentHero on your behalf.
    - A **refresh token** – this allows us to keep that connection going over time.
- The **access token** only lasts **30 minutes**, but don’t worry – PICMI refreshes it automatically in the background.
- The **refresh token** lasts **30 days**, but again, you don’t need to worry – PICMI automatically refreshes it after *
  *20 days** to keep things running smoothly.
- If the **refresh token ever expires**, you’ll need to re-authorise PICMI by going through the connection process
  again.

</explanation>

<explanation>

### API key

The API key is copied from Employment Hero and saved in the Configuration.

1. Sign in to Employment Hero
2. Top right button to menu > My Account
3. Locate Account Details > Api key
4. Click copy to clipboard
5. Paste back in PICMI > Integration
6. Save

</explanation>

## Troubleshooting

If you notice any discrepancies between PICMI and EmploymentHero:

- **Re-authorisation**: If needed, re-authorise the integration by reconnecting your EmploymentHero account.
- **Email field with sub-alias**: If an employee's job has ended and some time has passed, you can’t create a new user
  with the same email
  address. To handle this, PICMI will automatically create the user using a [sub-alias email](../faqs#emails) of the
  original email **adding the month and year** (eg `hone.smith+08-2024@example.com`)

::: prompt
PICMI will automatically keep your token up to date by refreshing it before it expires (at about the half-way point)
