# Biometric data for right to work

In Australia and New Zealand, employers are not required to store biometric data, such as a copy of the passport, to
comply with right-to-work laws. However, they must retain evidence that they have checked and verified an employee's
work eligibility.

Biometric data refers to unique physical or behavioural characteristics used to identify individuals. In the case of
identification it is usually facial features in digital images or scans of a person's face.

These forms of data are considered highly sensitive and are subject to strict privacy and security regulations.

## Why avoid storing biometric data?

* **Privacy laws**: biometric data is considered "sensitive information" under privacy laws in both jurisdictions and is
  subject to stricter handling requirements. Employers must only collect and retain what is strictly necessary.
* **Data security**: storing biometric data increases the risk of data breaches, which could lead to legal liabilities
  under privacy laws.

## What must be stored for right to work?

Employers are required to keep sufficient evidence to demonstrate compliance. This includes:

- Details of the document checked: For example, noting the passport number and its expiration date.
- Confirmation of work rights: Records showing the person’s eligibility, such as a verified right-to-work check.

## What you don’t need to store for right to work?

Employers do not need to store the passport image or biometric data, such as facial features or fingerprints embedded in
the passport.

## Best practice for right to work

Instead of storing biometric data

- Retain a record of the verification process, such as a written or electronic note confirming that the document was
  sighted and verified.
- Use secure systems to document and confirm compliance without needing to hold copies of passports or sensitive
  biometric data.

This approach ensures compliance while protecting employee privacy and reducing the risk of mishandling sensitive
information.

## Third-party systems

Several third-party systems are available to assist with biometric collection and verification processes. These tools
provide streamlined solutions for managing right-to-work compliance while ensuring data security and privacy.
