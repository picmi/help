# Linked files in your workflow

PICMI allows you to link external files within your workflow. This feature is designed to provide extra information to people completing your application workflow. We recommend using PDF files.

## Why use PDF files?

We recommend using PDF files over other formats because:
- PDFs are universally accessible across devices and operating systems
- They preserve formatting, ensuring consistent display
- They are less prone to editing, which maintains the integrity of shared information

## Mechanics of linking files

### Adding a file link to your workflow
1. Save the file in a location that is accessible to anyone (this means the file must be publicly shareable, and the link must not expire)
2. Ensure the file link is a **permanent link** (a link that remains unchanged, even if the file is updated)

### Key concepts
- **File**: The document or information you wish to share
- **Version**: Updates to the file without changing its link
- **Permanent link**: A stable link that can be reused across workflows and remains valid when the file is updated

### Goal
- Use **one permanent link** for the file
- Link it across multiple workflows
- Update the file using version control without altering the workflow link
- Ensure everyone accessing the link always sees the latest version of the file

## Using Google Drive for file linking

### First-time setup
1. **Create a folder**: Name it something like `Open Access Folder` to store your shared files so you can recognise that it has public access files
2. **Upload the file**: 
   - Rename the file to remove version numbers or dates from the title so the name remains consistent across versions
3. **Set sharing permissions**:
   - Share the file with *Anyone with the link*
   - Set access to *Viewer* to prevent edits
4. **Copy the permanent link**: Use this link to add the file to your workflow

### Updating files
To update a file without changing its link:
1. Go to the file in Google Drive and open **File Information > Manage Versions**
2. Click **Upload new version** and select the updated file
3. Ensure the new version is saved

The link remains unchanged, so workflows using this link automatically reflect the updated file.

## Using Microsoft OneDrive for file linking

PICMI discourages using Onedrive because it does not support the use of **permanent links** (as of Jan 2025) to facilitate versions on the same shared link without updating the workflow in PICMI. 

## Processing files: DOC → PDF

If the file is not yet in PDF format convert it to PDF before sharing—most applications now allow export to PDF
 
### Archiving old versions
- Retain the original version independently of `Open Access Folder`

### Recommendations for PDF files
- Add a footer with the date and version number for easy tracking.
