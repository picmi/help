# Linked videos in your workflow

PICMI allows you to link external videos within your workflow. This feature is designed to provide extra information to people completing your application workflow. 

PICMI doesn't host video files directly, so you'll need to use a video platform.

:::explanation
**Common video hosting options:**

- **YouTube** – Free, reliable, easy to embed
- **Vimeo** – Professional option with privacy controls
- **Google Drive** – Good for internal videos with access restrictions

Make sure your video is publicly accessible or properly shared so applicants can view it.

## Mechanics of linking videos

### Key concepts
- **File**: The video you wish to share
- **Version**: Updates to the file without changing its link
- **Permanent link**: A stable link that can be reused across workflows and remains valid when the file is updated

### Goal
- Use **one permanent link** for the file
- Link it across multiple workflows
- Update the file using version control without altering the workflow link
- Ensure everyone accessing the link always sees the latest version of the file

## Adding a video to your workflow

### Get the video link from youtube
1. Ensure you have the file in a location that is accessible to yourself (see [how to download](#downloading-videos-eg-vimeo-→-youtube) from the web)
2. [Upload](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407) to youtube
3. **Copy the permanent link**: use this link to add the link to your workflow

### Add video step to workflow

Now add the video to your workflow using the link you copied in the previous step.

:::instructions

1. Go to **Setup** → **Workflows**
2. Open the workflow you want to update
3. Navigate to the appropriate section (usually Health & Safety or Induction)
4. Add a new content block
5. Paste your video link or embed code
6. Add a description above the video explaining what it covers
7. Click **Save**
   :::

### Updating files

To update a file without changing its link, use the youtube **version** functionality

::: prompt
The link remains unchanged, so workflows using this link automatically reflect the updated file.

## Using youtube for videos

By uploading your videos to YouTube, you’ll have full control over your content and can update or replace videos anytime. You’ll also be able to track stats like watch time and viewer engagement. To start, [create an account](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/161805p) on youtube.

## Using Vimeo for videos

PICMI currently does not support the use of vimeo. Please [download](#downloading-videos-eg-vimeo-→-youtube) and then upload to youtube.

## Downloading videos: e.g. vimeo → youtube

If you already have a video in another system and do not have the source version, you will first need to download it before uploading to youtube.

We recommend https://www.savethevideo.com

:::: instructions
1. Locate the webpage that contains the video to download
2. Copy and paste the link into "video link box" https://www.savethevideo.com/home
3. Click Start, wait for the site to do the processing (note: it may open a new tab for advertising that should be closed)
4. In the dialog, select Merge > Merge Formats (yes, this will start the downloading)

::: prompt
Don't use **Download** because it separates Audio and Video
