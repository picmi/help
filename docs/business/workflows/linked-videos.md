## Mechanics of linking videos

### Key concepts
- **File**: The video you wish to share
- **Version**: Updates to the file without changing its link
- **Permanent link**: A stable link that can be reused across workflows and remains valid when the file is updated

### Goal
- Use **one permanent link** for the file
- Link it across multiple workflows
- Update the file using version control without altering the workflow link
- Ensure everyone accessing the link always sees the latest version of the file

## Adding a video to your workflow

### Get the video link from youtube
1. Ensure you have the file in a location that is accessible to yourself (see [how to download](#downloading-videos-eg-vimeo-→-youtube) from the web)
2. [Upload](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407) to youtube
3. **Copy the permanent link**: use this link to add the link to your workflow

### Add video step to workflow
1. In the workflow, add a Video item
2. Use the link above

### Updating files

To update a file without changing its link, use the youtube version functionality

::: prompt
The link remains unchanged, so workflows using this link automatically reflect the updated file.

## Using youtube for videos

By uploading your videos to YouTube, you’ll have full control over your content and can update or replace videos anytime. You’ll also be able to track stats like watch time and viewer engagement. To start, [create an account](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/161805p) on youtube.

## Using Vimeo for videos

PICMI currently does not support the use of vimeo. Please [download](#downloading-videos-eg-vimeo-→-youtube) and then upload to youtube.

## Downloading videos: e.g. vimeo → youtube

If you already have a video in another system and do not have the source version, you will first need to download it before uploading to youtube.

We recommend https://www.savethevideo.com

:::: instructions
1. Locate the webpage that contains the video to download
2. Copy and paste the link into "video link box" https://www.savethevideo.com/home
3. Click Start, wait for the site to do the processing (note: it may open a new tab for advertising that should be closed)
4. In the dialog, select Merge > Merge Formats (yes, this will start the downloading)

::: prompt
Don't use **Download** because it separates Audio and Video
