## Updating workflows across multiple jobs

When you update a workflow, the changes apply to all jobs using that workflow.

**How workflow updates work:**

- Changes to a workflow affect **all jobs** assigned to that workflow
- **Active applications** continue using the workflow version from when they started
- **New applicants** see the updated workflow immediately
- You don't need to update individual jobs after changing a workflow

This means one update can improve the experience for all future applicants across multiple jobs.

::: prompt
If you only want to change the workflow for one specific
job, [duplicate the workflow](creating-a-workflow#step-3-duplicate-your-base-workflow) and assign it to that job only.
:::

#### Best practice
- Keep headings short and meaningful.

:::faq Too many questions?

Every additional question reduces completion rates. Be ruthless about only collecting essential information during the
application stage.
:::

#### Troubleshooting
- Can’t add an item: Ensure you are in Edit mode (not Preview).
- Long pages: Split content with Section Headings or move some items to another page for better completion rates.
