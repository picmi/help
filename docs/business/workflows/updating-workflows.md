## Update a Workflow

Use this guide to add or edit content (questions, sections, and information) in a workflow.

### 1. Open your workflow
- Go to Setup → Workflows.
- Find the workflow to edit (e.g., Orchard – Fixed Term) and open it.

### 2. Enter edit mode
- In the workflow preview page, select **Edit** (bottom‑right) to switch from preview to editing.

### 3. Choose where to add content
- In the editor, each page (e.g., Health & Safety) shows its items.
- Use the side toolbar:
    - Plus (+) button: Add a new item to the current page.
    - List button: View or manage the page’s items.

Tip: You can also use "Add item to page" near the page title.

### 4. Pick the item type to add
After clicking +, select from:
- **Question:** Add an existing question.
- **Information:** Add known fields for candidates to answer.
- **Section Heading:** Insert a heading to break up content.
- **Section Image:** Show an image block.
- **Section Video:** Embed a video block.
- **Section Data:** Add a structured data/table section.

### Configure the item
- For Section Heading:
    - Set Type: Section Heading.
    - Enter a Heading (short title candidates will see).
    - Optionally add Subheading/body content using the editor (bullets, bold, links).

Best practice:
- Keep headings short and meaningful.

Troubleshooting
- Can’t add an item: Ensure you are in Edit mode (not Preview).
- Long pages: Split content with Section Headings or move some items to another page for better completion rates.
