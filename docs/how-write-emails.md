We’re here to support you, and the more detail you can share upfront, the faster we can resolve your issue.  
Here’s a quick checklist and guide to help you send the most effective support request.

## Quick Checklist

Before sending your email, make sure you’ve included:

- ☐ What you were trying to do
- ☐ What went wrong (expected vs actual result)
- ☐ Any error messages or screenshots
- ☐ Steps to reproduce the issue (if relevant)
- ☐ Any recent changes that might affect it
- ☐ Urgency level (optional but helpful)
- ☐ Organisation / job / person details (if applicable)
- ☐ Be specific in the subject line (review this after you've written the email!)

## 1. Tell us what you’re trying to do

A short sentence is often enough. If you think there are multiple questions, break them into separate lines or, even
better, separate emails.

**Examples:**

- “I’m trying to publish a job.”
- “I’m onboarding a candidate.”

## 2. Describe what went wrong

Let us know what you expected to happen and what actually happened.

## 3. Add screenshots or error messages

They help us diagnose the issue immediately and avoid back-and-forth. If you received screenshots from the person applying,
please include them in the email.

## 4. Share steps to reproduce (if you can)

Just a few bullet points help us recreate the issue on our side. Often writing this will help us identify the problem
faster.

## 5. Mention any recent changes

Sometimes a small change is the key to solving the problem:

- Job updated
- Workflow added or changed
- Integration changed

## 6. Tell us if it’s urgent

If something is blocking your work, let us know so we can prioritise.

## 7. Include relevant account details

It really does help us find your setup quickly. Often this is in your email signature but if it doesn't match the organisation
in PICMI, please include it separately.

**Examples:**

- Organisation name
- Job title
- Person name or email address
