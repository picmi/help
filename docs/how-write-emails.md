## Quick Checklist

Before sending your email, make sure you’ve included:

☐ What you were trying to do
☐ What went wrong (expected vs actual result)
☐ Any error messages or screenshots
☐ Steps to reproduce the issue (if relevant)
☐ Any recent changes that might affect it
☐ Urgency level (optional but helpful)
☐ Organisation / job / person details (if applicable)
☐ Be specific in the subject line (review this after you've written the email!)

## 1. Tell us what you’re trying to do

A short sentence is often enough. If you think there are multiple questions, break them into separate lines or, even
better, separate emails.

**Examples:**

- I'm trying to invite a person to a job
- My search results are not returning all the jobs I expected
- The birthdate field errors on import
- The name field is corrupted after I import a CSV
- The report is not listed for download
- The jobseeker is reporting that the pay rate is incorrect
- The jobseeker reports that they have not received an invite email

## 2. Describe what went wrong

Let us know what you expected to happen and what actually happened.

## 3. Add screenshots or error messages

They help us diagnose the issue immediately and avoid back-and-forth. If you received screenshots from the person
applying, please include them in the email.

It's okay to provide multiple screenshots if they help us understand the issue better.

::: prompt
Support teams rely heavily on screenshots to quickly understand customer issues. But raw, unedited screenshots often
include unnecessary or distracting information. Cropping improves clarity and reduces back-and-forth communication.

**Tips for Effective Cropping**

* Keep the focus area centered.
* Include labels or context needed to understand the issue (e.g., the field name + error message).
* Exclude unrelated browser tabs, personal data, or empty space.
* If multiple elements are relevant, include all of them but keep it tight.

## 4. Share steps to reproduce (if you can)

Just a few bullet points help us recreate the issue on our side. Often writing this will help us identify the problem
faster.

:::prompt
Sometimes by writing down the problem you may even find and fix it yourself!
:::

## 5. Mention any recent changes

Sometimes a small change is the key to solving the problem:

- Job updated
- Workflow added or changed
- Integration changed

## 6. Tell us if it’s urgent

If something is blocking your work, let us know so we can prioritise.

## 7. Include relevant account details

It really does help us find your setup quickly. Often this is in your email signature, but if it doesn't match the
organisation in PICMI, please include it separately.

**Examples:**

- Organisation name
- Job title
- Person name or email address (receiving the agreement)
