# Creating an account

Creating a PICMI account is free and easy. You are most likely to have received an email with a link to job and this
means that you already have an account. Follow the link in the email and you will be good to go.

You can sign up using any of the following:

* Email address
* Google account

<prompt>

Can't find an email, check [email not found](../../email-not-found.md) or want to [sign in](sign-in.md)?

</prompt>
