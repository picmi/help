# Understanding applications

In PICMI, an **application** is the way you track your progress towards securing a job. It represents your interest in
joining an organisation's workforce for a specific role. The application process consists of several steps, including
answering questions, reviewing information, watching videos, signing declarations, and reviewing and accepting a
contract. These steps are organised into pages within the application.

Once all the required steps are completed, an **offer** will be made to you. Before final acceptance, there is an
*agree** stage, allowing for a legally required cooling-off period.

Each application has a **status** that reflects its current stage. Some status changes may also trigger **notifications
**, keeping you informed about updates and any necessary actions.

## Application status

Your **application status** shows where you are in the process of securing a job. The statuses are:

- **Invited** – You have been invited to apply but haven’t started yet.
- **In Progress** – You are actively working on your application.
- **Offered** – You have met all the criteria, and an offer has been extended.
- **Accepted** – You have agreed to the offer and are in the cooling-off period.
- **Completed** – Your contract is finalised, and the process is complete.
- **Declined** – You have chosen not to proceed with the application.
- **Cancelled** – The application was cancelled before completion.

## Actions you can take

Depending on your application status, you can take different actions:

| **Status**  | **Action**         | **Explanation**                                                 |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Invited     | *Apply*, *Decline* | Start your application or decline the invitation.               |
| In Progress | *Decline*          | You can stop your application at any time.                      |
| Offered     | *Agree*, *Decline* | Accept or decline the job offer.                                |
| Accepted    | *Cancel*           | Withdraw your acceptance if needed.                             |
| Declined    | *Reopen*           | Reopen the application if you change your mind.                 |
| Completed   |                    | No further actions available—only the business can make changes |
| Cancelled   |                    | No further actions available—only the business can make changes |

## Restrictions on applying

Some jobs may have restrictions on who can apply:

- **Invites only** – You can only apply if you received an invitation from the organisation.
- **Vacancies** – If the job has reached its maximum number of accepted applications, no more offers can be made.
