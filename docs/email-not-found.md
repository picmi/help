# Email not found in inbox

When PICMI sends emails through a service like AWS, there are a few reasons why these emails might not look or behave like those sent directly from a person. Firstly, most emails come from a general address, `hello@picmi.io`, rather than a personal email, which can make them feel less familiar. These service emails also have added security features that help prevent them from being marked as spam, increasing the chances that they'll reach your inbox. Additionally, the service can send many emails at once, which personal accounts may struggle to do without issues. Lastly, using a professional email service means that PICMI can manage important details like compliance with email regulations which personal emails don't offer. So, if you're having trouble finding an email, it might be worth checking your spam or other folders instead of assuming there's a problem with PICMI's emails

## How to Find an Email You Can't See in Your Inbox

If you're unable to find an email in your inbox, follow these steps to locate it:

## 1. **Check Other Folders**
- **Spam/Junk Folder:** Sometimes, legitimate emails may be mistakenly marked as spam. Check your Spam or Junk folder to see if the email is there.

- **Trash/Bin:** If you accidentally deleted the email, it may still be in the Trash. Check there before emptying it.
- **Archive Folder:** The odd time the email has been archived (based on a rule), you can find it in the Archive folder.

## 2. **Look in Other Tabs or Categories**
- If you are using a service like Gmail, your inbox may be divided into tabs (Primary, Social, Promotions). Check these tabs to see if the email has been sorted elsewhere.

## 3. **Use the Search Function**
- Most email services have a search bar at the top. Enter keywords related to the email, the subject line, or any specific terms you remember.
    * **From:** `hello@picmi.io`
    * **Subject:** `PICMI`
    * Additional **keywords** to add to the subject search from specific actions
      * Sign up/Sign in: `code`
      * Invite: `waiting`

## 4. **Check Filters and Sorting Options**
- Make sure you are not applying any filters that could be hiding emails. Clear any active filters.
- Check the sorting options (e.g., sorting by date, sender, etc.) to ensure that emails are displayed correctly.

## 5. **Check Your Settings**
- Review your email settings to ensure that nothing is preventing emails from appearing in your inbox. Check any rules or filters that may automatically move or delete emails.
